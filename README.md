# loadPrediction
Loan Approval Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)


# Feature Selection:
Identification of relevant features such as income, luxury_assets_value, employment
status, and loan amount.
- Data Preprocessing:
  a) Cleaning and handling missing data to ensure the quality of the dataset.
  b) Normalization or scaling of numerical features to bring them to a comparable scale.
  c) Encoding categorical variables for input into neural networks.
- Model Architecture:
Selection of appropriate neural network architecture, which may include:
  a) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): The most common architecture, consisting of an input
layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.
  b) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Consider sequential patterns in data (e.g., past
loan payment behavior) for prediction.
  c) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Efficiently extract features from spatial
patterns (e.g., images, text) if applicable.

# LITERATURE REVIEW

- Model Training:
  a) Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.
  b) Utilization of optimization algorithms like Adam, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), or
      variations of gradient descent for training the neural network.
  c) Propagation of the errors backward through the network to adjust weights and biases,
      leading to better predictions.

- Evaluation Metrics:
    Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-
    score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
